Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions.

Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
