This type of POS solution is suitable for mobile vendors, coffee shops, gift shops, small retail stores, pizzerias, ice cream parlors, art galleries, small theatres, salons, quick-service restaurants, juice bars, and professional services.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.
