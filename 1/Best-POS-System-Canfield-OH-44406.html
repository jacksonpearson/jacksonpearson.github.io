<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
<h2>Essential Tips For Choosing Right Point Of Sale System Canfield</h2>

<h2>POS System Providers Canfield OH</h2>

The system may also allow you to see how close a table is to finishing, helping you avoid giving inaccurate wait times and potentially lose fewer customers. Spoiling your customers for choice is now an easy thing- the system is built with the ability to apply discounts, accept multiple modes of payment and can even use different ways to give customers the receipt.</p>
<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>Most cloud based pos companies provide a monthly subscription often upgrade their software, and you'll get the most up-to-date features with no additional fee.
