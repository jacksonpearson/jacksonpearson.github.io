<h2>POS For Small Retail Store Fort Thomas KY</h2>
<p>POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals. RFID in POS can further allow for charging to a customer's card via smartphone before they leave the store. We've provided retail POS systems to thousands of merchants in a variety of industry verticals.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>The software permits you to issue receipts, track sales, and perform back-office functions. If the quality of the software, support, and services will prove itself as an investment — not just an extra business expense — it'll be worth it. You get to hit two birds with one stone by combining retail POS with ecommerce functionality, so you never miss a sale. It used to be that having a good product was enough to get you by. Now it takes a lot more information in order to compete with all the other restaurants in your market that are all looking for the same customer you have seated in your restaurant.</p>
