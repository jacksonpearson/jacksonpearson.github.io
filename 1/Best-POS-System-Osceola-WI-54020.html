<p>Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation. They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>My previous experience was also in e-commerce, so I'd seen the first-hand benefits that retail technology could have when it came to time savings and sales insights. Menu building — Building a menu can be a complex endeavor, but restaurant POS systems allow you to see your inventory and build a menu that's appropriate. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions.</p>

If a customer wants a certain style or color that is not available at their location, a store associate will save the sale by helping the customer place the order from the store's iPad before they go.</p>
<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
