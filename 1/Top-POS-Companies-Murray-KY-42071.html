<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. Otherwise, your business's and your customers' financial information could be at risk.

More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>Research has shown repeatedly that errors are dozens of times more likely with manually calculated balances as opposed to those derived at automatically by software. Lavu empowers restaurant owners with full control over their operations and enables staff to maintain top-notch customer support standards.
