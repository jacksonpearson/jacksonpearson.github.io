Since your ecommerce and in-store solution will be connected with Shopify POS, customers will have the ability to return or exchange an online purchase at a local retail location. If the POS system holds data on recent purchases at the supermarket, then in order to transfer that data to ERP, the employee will have to input that information again in the ERP system in order to ensure proper accounting of the supermarket's cash flow.</p>
<p>Gift cards continue to be the most requested gift item and a go-to gift idea for the holidays and for businesses. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud.
