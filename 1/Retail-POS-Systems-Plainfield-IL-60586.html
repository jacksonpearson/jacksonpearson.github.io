<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>A functioning POS gift card program can also help retain customers. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants.</p>

<p>ShopKeep is an elegant and easy-to-use iPad POS that can work great for smaller and midsize bars looking to keep things simple and inexpensive.
