<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place.

Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient.
