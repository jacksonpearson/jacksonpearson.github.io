<p>Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars. A good POS system can speed up payment times, help waiters or bar staff to take large orders, and help kitchen staff to manage output effectively. You can't expect your clients to enjoy there shopping if they stand in a queue for 15 - 20 minutes, so be sure the point of sale (POS) retail side is fast.</p>
<p>And unsurprisingly, 71% of Americans think that a credit or debit card is the most convenient payment method. It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic).</p>
