<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>It means the point of sale transaction or deal that happens between a merchant and a customer at the time of purchasing the product or service. It has a built-in queue capability that handles long lines without the need to take numbers; all your customers need to do is sit back until the next sales agent is available. With the right bar management software and technology, owners and operators can increase their profit margins and better understand both their business and their customers.</p>

<p>The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management.
