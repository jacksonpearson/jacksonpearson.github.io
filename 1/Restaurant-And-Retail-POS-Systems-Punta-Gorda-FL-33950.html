<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. Acquire, retain and engage your customers, increase their average spend, manage inventory and visualize sales analytics. Wearables like Disney's Magicband may seem relegated to expensive experiences for now, but wearable computing will soon change how restaurants interact with customers and accept payment. Shopkeep POS has the best Retail POS System mobile app on the market. Understanding the basics of how point-of-sale (POS) systems work and the implementation process is essential to know, especially if you're looking to buy a new system.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>

Another open source POS software option is Floreant The software was created to help a Denny's restaurant in Oneonta, New York, upgrade its system in 2008, and it has been downloaded over 122,000 times.

<p>A countertop POS station typically includes a tablet and stand, receipt printer, and cash drawer You will also need a credit card terminal or card reader.

Many bar owners look for other helpful POS software features, like a fast user interface, tab transfer and selection, tip accounting, and surcharge and cash discount capabilities. Restaurant Software -FusionResto software lets you manage & run your restaurant business more efficiently through intuitive features.</p>
<p>How a customer experiences your brand when they visit your stores is a strong indicator as to whether they will become a repeat customer or leave you for competitors with better service. Sales reports are the cornerstone of every business and they provide an overview of all transactions over a period of time. Needless to say that a television set cannot help directly in boosting your business but indirectly it can entertain your customers.</p>
<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control, and these features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems.</p>
