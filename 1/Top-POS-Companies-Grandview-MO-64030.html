<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>It performs all those functions that the aforementioned hardware applications are capable of. Besides, modern POS software applications also help in managing inventory. In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver.
