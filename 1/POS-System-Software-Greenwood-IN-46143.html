<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost.

<h2>Best Point Of Sale (POS) System For Small Business Greenwood</h2>
<p>Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Read real customer reviews to see why retailers choose Cumulus Retail over other retail management and ePOS systems, such as Lightspeed, Springboard, Vend, Shopkeep and more.</p>
<p>Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit.
