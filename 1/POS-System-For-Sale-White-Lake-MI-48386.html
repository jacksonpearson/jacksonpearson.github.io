<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>

<p>Quid POS is a cloud-based point of sale system on Android & web for independent merchants to easily manage, automate & grow their shop. Better communication to your wait staff means better service to your customers. You also can restrict employee access to software features, including voiding sales, through password privileges and management-only applications. Because of this, retailers and POS vendors worked to standardise the development of computerised Point of Sale systems and to simplify the interconnectivity of Point of Sale devices.</p>

Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations.
