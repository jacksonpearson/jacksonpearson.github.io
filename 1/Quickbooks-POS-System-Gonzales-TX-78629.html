<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>This meant that the business either opted not to accept those forms of payment or accepted them knowing that there was a possibility that they would never actually receive the payment as it was hard to verify the accounts. Financial Statements: Finally, one of the most important features of a restaurant POS system. When you install new point of sale software for your business, make sure that your employers attend a mandatory training session to acquaint them with the intricacies of the program.</p>

When success depends on superior service, you need flexible POS software and Back-Office solutions for managing every aspect of your restaurant business. Many POS software can be integrated to 3rd party software such as accounting software for bookkeeping, email marketing solutions, and ecommerce platforms for selling online.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system.

Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money.</p>
