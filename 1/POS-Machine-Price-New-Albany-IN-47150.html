More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>You can also build visually stunning online stores with highly-customizable themes. Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. Note that these fees are determined by the payment processor, not by the POS provider (although sometimes the POS provider will make you use their in-house payment processor).
