There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit.

For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Real-time reporting — the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs.</p>
<p>We are honored to announce that the cross-platform, cross-channel POS and retail management software Retail Pro® was ranked number 1 retail mid-market POS in market share, global reach, innovation, and growth in the latest Retail Executive Advisory Program Research Study from IHL Group.
