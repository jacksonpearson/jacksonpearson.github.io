<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>

<p>You can also build visually stunning online stores with highly-customizable themes. Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. Note that these fees are determined by the payment processor, not by the POS provider (although sometimes the POS provider will make you use their in-house payment processor).
