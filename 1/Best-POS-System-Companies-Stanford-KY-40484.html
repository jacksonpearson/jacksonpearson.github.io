Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>
