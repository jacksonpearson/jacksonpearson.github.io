<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Pros: Offers more features than most, including some customer relationship management functionality. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Revel , which was founded in 2010, is an iPad point-of-sale system ideal for larger restaurants such as franchises, catering services and restaurants with multiple locations. With RETAILvantage data capture is faster and more accurate, costs are lower, mistakes are minimized, and keeping a customer satisfied is much easier.</p>

<p>Features include inventory and labor management, reports and analytics, scheduling, loyalty programs, a self-service kiosk, and a kitchen display system. The first one is the mobile payment system that, thanks to the use of WiFi tablets and mobile POS, allows an exclusive payment via mobile and card only, potentially everywhere in the store, reducing the time spent in a queue. Our standard restaurant point of sale includes a touchscreen POS terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and kitchen printer.</p>
<p>With our mobile card reader, you can start taking card, contactless and device payments. Every restaurant needs the efficiency-enhancing, business-building and security features of a quality point of sale system, but many businesses haven't reached the point where the expense can be justified. Logic POS is an integrated system with mainly three components: A POS front end, an inventory or stock management system in the middle and a back-office accounting systems.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages provided by the modern day POS systems is the help they can offer you by tracking your inventory levels. Whatever the case may be, there seems to be a misconception out there that retail point of sale (POS) systems can work as substitutes for a restaurant POS and that notion is just plain wrong. Investing in a POS system can simplify many of the operations in your bar, making it easier for you to increase efficiency, profitability, and customer service.</p>
<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>

<p>Especially strong inventory features with detailed sales numbers, discount tracking, and order history. Our clients are using jRestaurant POS system with success and have been the pioneers in some of the features presented in this software. EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra.</p>
<p>If you end up with a system that skimps in this department, you may find yourself having to find other, separate software apps for things like accounting, inventory, and employee management. You can also run email marketing, customer loyalty plans, and gift card programs from Square's point-of-sale software. A point-of-sale, or POS, system is the hardware and software that allows a business to process customer payments for products and services.</p>
