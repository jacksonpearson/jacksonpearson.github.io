<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>

For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.” POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting.
