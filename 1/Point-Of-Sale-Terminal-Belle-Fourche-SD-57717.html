Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>The UnifiesPOS standard, to which all POS systems had to conform, was led by The National Retail Foundation. The staff management module makes managing your staff easy.
