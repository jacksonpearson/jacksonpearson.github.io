<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. Otherwise, your business's and your customers' financial information could be at risk. With handheld technology designed for the restaurant environment, you can enable your team to spend more time with guests, accelerate service, and speed up checkout through tableside ordering and payments.
