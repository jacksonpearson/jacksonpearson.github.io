<p>If you have a large bar but offer food items on your menu as well, you may need to manage seating.

Focus POS systems are PCI-compliant; easy to use, install and maintain; and deliver return on investment by maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing costs.</p>

Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
