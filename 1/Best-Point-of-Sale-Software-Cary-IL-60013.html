If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store.

The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.</p>

<p>If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space. Whether you run a clothing store, a sporting goods store, or a specialty service-based business such as a car wash or computer shop, Vend has the features you need. EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip.</p>

Customers can download the app instead of swiping or punching cards, to keep track of their purchases and earn reward points. Using it in conjunction with POS software enables you to serve your customers more quickly and accurately.
