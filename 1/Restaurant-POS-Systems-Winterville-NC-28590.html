<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Transactions, replacing the cash registers with a Point-Of-Sale (POS) system save you money. For multiple terminals, additional PC server will be needed to consolidate all sales data and provide more sophisticate reporting to management.

<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment.
