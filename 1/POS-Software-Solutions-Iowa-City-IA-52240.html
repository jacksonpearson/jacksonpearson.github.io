Today's point-of-sale software contains many more features in addition to the computerized cash register. While the features above are important to consider when picking out a POS for your restaurant, you should go beyond just the features.</p>
<p>Using inventory management software helps you easily set par level. We needed software that's mobile, versatile, and stable enough to handle popup store requirements. We have solutions that allow adding and removing items from your menu management console to be pushed across multiple trucks with one touch. Shoplifting costs retail businesses large amounts of money each year and knowing what items are being stolen will allow you to take steps to stop the theft.</p>
