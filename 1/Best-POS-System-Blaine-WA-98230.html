<p>Nowadays point of sale bar code scanners are an absolute necessity in any retail business. Its built-in marketing tools enable you to deliver the right content, product and offer to your customers at the right time. ECR Software's Catapult is a unified POS platform for grocery stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and specialty food and beverage stores. Global inventory, cross-channel orders and customer profiles are completely visible in real-time so associates are equipped to deliver thoughtful, knowledge-based interactions with a personal touch.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
