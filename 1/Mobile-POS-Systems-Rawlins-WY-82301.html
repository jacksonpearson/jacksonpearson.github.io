<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.
