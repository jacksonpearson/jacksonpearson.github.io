Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>

<h2>Point Of Sale Basics Orange CA</h2>

<p>Ingredient management helps reduce unaccounted for food items which helps to stay on a budget easier. Other features include simple bill splitting, staff management capabilities, inventory tracking, floor layout configurations and sales reporting.
