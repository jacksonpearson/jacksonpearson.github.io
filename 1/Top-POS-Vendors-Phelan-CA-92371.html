<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. While a cash register only stores money and is often attached to a computer or bar code scanner a point of sale or POS does this all in one interface.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that if you will be accepting debit and credit cards (which are required by most businesses), you need a service that will process all of your payments. A specialized system with bar-specific features will do so much more for your business than a general POS. Features include appointment scheduling, employee management, inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and gift card and loyalty programs.</p>
