<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>

And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>

<p>Keeping customers happy is made possible by a customer profiling tool which lets you create the best rewards and incentives for returning customers and new conversions.
