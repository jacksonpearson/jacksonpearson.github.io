<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>
