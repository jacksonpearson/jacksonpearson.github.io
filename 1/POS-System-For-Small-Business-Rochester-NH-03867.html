<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.

Vend POS is one the most flexible Retail POS Systems on the market, boasting third-party add-ons galore and compatibility with many operating systems.

Besides increasing convenience, this could enable POSs, loyalty, and payments to be rolled into a single customer-centric experience.</p>

More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>

Lavu empowers restaurant owners with full control over their operations and enables staff to maintain top-notch customer support standards.
