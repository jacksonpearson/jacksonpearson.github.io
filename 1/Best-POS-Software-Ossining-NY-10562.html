<p>POS software offer's your business many conveniences that you simply can't afford to be without. The retail boom has been fuelled by new business model of franchising where multiple entrepreneurs take up part of the risk of inventory. Customize your loyalty program to offer a free product on the fifth visit or 10% off for every $100 spent or even reward a frequent buyer with a discount, store credit, or gift card. With Poster, you can reduce your startup costs and switch between payment plans anytime to catch up with your business growth.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>
