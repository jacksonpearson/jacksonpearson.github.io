<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. A POS system has features that support the rationalization of a small or large retail business's day to day operations. Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software. However, POS software is quite scalable and modules can be added for accounting, inventory and even customer relationship management (CRM.) Value priced software choices are available that can give a small shop owner some of the tools the large fortune 500 retailers use.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
