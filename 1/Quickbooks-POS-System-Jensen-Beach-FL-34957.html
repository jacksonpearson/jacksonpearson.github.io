<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you. Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. POS systems also offer reliable add-ons and hardware systems such as barcode scanners, cash drawers, receipt printers, and card swipers.</p>
