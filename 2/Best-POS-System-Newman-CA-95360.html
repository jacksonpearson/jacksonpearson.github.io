<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions. The most important use of this system to a business owner is its ability to allow your business to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely. We'll start with what POS software can do. As a reminder, the point of sale software is what you use in conjunction with POS hardware to run transactions.
