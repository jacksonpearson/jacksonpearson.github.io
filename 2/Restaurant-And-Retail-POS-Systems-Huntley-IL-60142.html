<p>Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register. For example, if you're opening up a salon, you may want to look for a POS system that can handle complex scheduling and one that can manage payments and tipping to multiple individual employees.</p>
