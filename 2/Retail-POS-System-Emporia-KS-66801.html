<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges. Most of you are familiar with point of sale (POS) systems, even if you don't realize it. Remote access: Some POS systems can act as bar and restaurant management software, allowing managers to view sales figures, stock data and much more, remotely. Whether you're serving drinks at happy hour, serving customers a quick meal or brewing up the latest imported coffee bean, eHopper is made for multiple types of small businesses.</p>

<p>Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction. Many POS systems are tailor-made and marketed to specific types of businesses, especially full-service restaurants or retail. Depending on the software, merchants can track not only their sales but also inventory levels, gross revenues, profit margins, sales patterns and a whole host of other data points.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. See an instant snapshot of sales, staff performance, stock, costs and much more in real-time, from anywhere. For the purpose of rationalizing of everyday activities, a POS system is very beneficial to small and big businesses alike.</p>

<p>The UnifiesPOS standard, to which all POS systems had to conform, was led by The National Retail Foundation. The staff management module makes managing your staff easy.
