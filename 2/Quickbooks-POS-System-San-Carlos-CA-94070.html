<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>I use livepos in my store, it has the features I need to run my business. Apply surcharges or discounts and accept cash, credit cards, account sales and more.
