<p>For most retailers, point of sale technology (POS) is fast becoming the best choice for increasing sales. Because the platform can speed up your processes and cut waiting times, customers get to have a richer experience and, therefore, improved satisfaction, which results in repeat business. This software facilitates ordering, billing, reporting, accounting, table tracking, and receipt printing for restaurants and bars. Dinerware's independent dealers have different pricing structures, but most have monthly support plans and the option to purchase or lease hardware, Dinerware Sales and Marketing Lead Madeline Stockwell says in an email.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business.</p>

Common POS systems include a computer, receipt printer, lockable cash drawer, a scanner to read the bar code, a magnetic swipe reader and a modem and pole display. POS software companies can be found right online with just a simple search, and you will even find open source POS software, but again I suggest that you stay far away from it. They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>
