<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity.

It automatically updates the essential database from customers, products, inventory, sales, loyalty programs and labor.
