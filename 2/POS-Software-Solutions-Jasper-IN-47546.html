<p>Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars.

You can't expect your clients to enjoy there shopping if they stand in a queue for 15 - 20 minutes, so be sure the point of sale (POS) retail side is fast.</p>
<p>The components of a POS system include hardware, software and operational features. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors. POS software or POS systems are located wherever a transaction occurs, which generally tends to mean the terminal that is used for checkouts.</p>
