<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. What Imonggo's free plan doesn't offer is broad integration capabilities, offline access, or the option to accept credit card payments.

<h3>Hosted Point Of Sale Applications Oakdale New York</h3>
<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
<p>Although its focus is hospitality businesses, salons and retail stores can also use it.
