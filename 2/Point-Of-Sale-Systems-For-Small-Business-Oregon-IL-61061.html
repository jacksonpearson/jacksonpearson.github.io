<p>If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space.

EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip.</p>

Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
