Reprint this ticket 10 times and sell and collect for themselves these reprinted receipts instead of ringing up new customers. The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. Toast itself acts as the client's payment processor, and unlike many of its iOS-based competitors in the POS world, runs on Android operating systems, making it at once cheaper and more versatile.</p>

<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality.

<p>Manage Specials - POS systems automate the process of tracking current and marked down pricing. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. Improves inventory management, a crucial component of a busy deli. Menu item cost is a significant result of how computer technology improves bar and grill business.</p>
