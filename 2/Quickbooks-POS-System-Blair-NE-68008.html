<p>The uAccept POS system from Workwell Technologies comes with a touchscreen, card reader, receipt printer and cash drawer. This can help attract repeat business and effectively help you market to interested customers. Since your ecommerce and in-store solution will be connected with Shopify POS, customers will have the ability to return or exchange an online purchase at a local retail location. If the POS system holds data on recent purchases at the supermarket, then in order to transfer that data to ERP, the employee will have to input that information again in the ERP system in order to ensure proper accounting of the supermarket's cash flow.</p>

Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
