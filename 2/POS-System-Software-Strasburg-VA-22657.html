<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution.

Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment â€”a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>

Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours.

As a reminder, the point of sale software is what you use in conjunction with POS hardware to run transactions.
