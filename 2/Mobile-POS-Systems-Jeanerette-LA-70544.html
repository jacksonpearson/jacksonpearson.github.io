Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar.

It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
