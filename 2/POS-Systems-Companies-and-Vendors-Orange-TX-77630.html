<p>Increase customer retention, run your own loyalty program, boost your sales. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. The restaurant POS software does not work well with the retailer's needs. This provides you with accurate inventory numbers to quote product levels to customers and helps ensure you don't sell more of any one inventory item than you have stock to close the sale.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
