Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years.

Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>It means the point of sale transaction or deal that happens between a merchant and a customer at the time of purchasing the product or service. It has a built-in queue capability that handles long lines without the need to take numbers; all your customers need to do is sit back until the next sales agent is available. With the right bar management software and technology, owners and operators can increase their profit margins and better understand both their business and their customers.</p>
