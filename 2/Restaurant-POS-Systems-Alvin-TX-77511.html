<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. Relying on an iPads is also a big perk, as it saves space and makes it easy for servers, hosts, managers, and bartenders to create and edit orders anywhere. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>
<h2>Modern Business Technology For A Restaurant Alvin</h2>
<p>Square's simple and affordable POS hardware and software let you take payments anywhere your customers can meet you. Very few people (only 5.2%) pay with either checks or RFID mobile payments (sometimes called contactless payments). It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork.

To this end, many retailers are seeking a cloud-based strategy to meet employee and customer needs.</p>
<p>Some bars even implement mobile POS systems at tables, which allow customers to order, pay and perform other collective actions, without having to attract the attention of the staff. Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>

<p>The app integrates with other available Zomato products for an all-around POS system that helps you offer customers the best dining experience.

When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.
