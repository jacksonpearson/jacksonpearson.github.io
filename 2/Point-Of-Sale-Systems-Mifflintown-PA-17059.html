Shopify POS is an iPad and iPhone-based point of sale application that allows you to manage your entire online and physical store business using a unified platform. Having these options is mostly a no-brainer these days because you have access to all your sales and programming data online remotely or through an App. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>

<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point.
