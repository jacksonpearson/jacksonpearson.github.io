Typically, the term ‘ point of sale ' (often shortened to ‘POS') applies to the combined functions of a hardware device or devices and related software that provides the ability for a merchant such as a small business or sole trader to process payments for products or services.</p>
<p>The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. When you have enough personnel on the sales floor and at the cash wrap, shoppers intuitively get the message that they are worth your time and staff investment. Track customers' buying behaviors and create targeted marketing campaigns to retain current customers and win new business.</p>
<p>So these POS systems have powerful tools for quickly taking orders in the front of the house and keeping up with the hectic operations and inventory needs in the back. Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes.
