Whether you're a full service, fine dining, fast food, or quick-service restaurant, you need a bar and restaurant POS system to manage your business. AccuCOUNT the inventory management system lets you handle pricing, take delivery orders wirelessly, and adjust inventory count.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
