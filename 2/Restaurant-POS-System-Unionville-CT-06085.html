It offers the Masterdine POS for restaurants and the STORCheck POS for retailers. Keep track of your customers habits and send them special offers and sale notices. For example, Square offers a customer loyalty program where customers earn redeemable points on sales.</p>

With real-time restaurant inventory software, you can track your food inventory, suppliers, units, and prices on your computer, phone, or tablet so you know what to reorder and when — without having to spend long hours updating a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Not only this, by using an efficient restaurant management software, you can avoid any embarrassments and possible loss of business that may be a result of overbooking, double-booking, or lags in customer service. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction. Most POS companies will program your menu or inventory items as an existing customer or additionally for a fee.</p>
<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.
