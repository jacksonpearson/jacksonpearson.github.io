<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>

To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
<p>Despite the cash register motif, however, when people talk about POS systems, they're mostly referring to the software, which could be client-based or cloud-based. There are a lot of specialized systems out there for the restaurant or hospitality business, so if you're selling flowers or handmade bags, make sure you find a POS tool with all of the bells and whistles to make your products sing and your customers stick around.</p>
