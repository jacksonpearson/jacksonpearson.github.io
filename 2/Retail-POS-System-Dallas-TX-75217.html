Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>All of the systems are EMV-compliant These POS systems also support NFC (near-field communication) technology, which enables contactless payments through mobile wallets such as Apple Pay. NCR Silver is a cloud-based POS system that delivers big-business features on a small-business budget. It also features a detachable Android tablet, offering the flexibility to serve customers from anywhere in the salon. Live stock by line has been a huge transformation for a company operating in several locations, meaning that regardless of location, all stores are selling items at the correct price as well as having the ability to sell from another location so as to secure the customer purchase.</p>
