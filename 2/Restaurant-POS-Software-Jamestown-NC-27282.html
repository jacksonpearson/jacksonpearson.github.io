<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. POS vendors and retailers are working hard to standardise the technology behind POS systems, to drive down manufacturing and product costs. With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry. From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants.</p>
<p>Features include sales snapshots, void reports by employee, detailed credit card payment reports and detailed shift reports. Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>
<h2>Modern Business Technology For A Restaurant Jamestown</h2>
<p>Say goodbye to ugly, expensive, outdated POS systems and enjoy an interface designed for modern retailers. Pick your own credit card processor and Bindo will handle just about everything else, from shift management and cash drawers to e-commerce and order management. We hear from brick and mortar retail stores looking to sell their goods online all the time.

C modern retail business will find it very difficult to survive without a POS system.</p>
