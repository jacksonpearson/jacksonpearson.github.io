<p>Choosing your point of sale, or POS, systems could be a disaster if you approach the wrong dealer and go for the wrong equipment. This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp.

Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems.
