<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>
