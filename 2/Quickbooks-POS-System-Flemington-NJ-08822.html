<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS. Customer relationship - By storing customer data and purchase history, the POS system helps in retaining the customers. This free POS software is based on the same Fieldpine engine used in their premier versions, but available free without any time restrictions. Vend tracks every sale in real time, which allows us to view overall sales throughout the day or week.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
