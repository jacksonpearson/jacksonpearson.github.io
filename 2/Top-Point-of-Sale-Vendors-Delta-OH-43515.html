<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient. This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender.</p>

<p>The retail companies, grocery shops, and hospitality businesses like restaurants and hotels can benefit highly from a POS system. Retailer Lyn Evans created that kind of no-disappointment experience for their customers. POS systems can be extremely cheap or very expensive, and all charge a payment processing fee.

As a retailer, it's necessary that you have an online store and as an online storeowner, it is necessary that your shopping cart integrate with your Dynamics RMS.</p>

While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers.</p>
