<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>

Other Rezku features include integrated time clock, tableside ordering and payments, cash drawer, kitchen display system, and more.

<p>These registers have been replaced by technology known as point of sale (POS) systems; which nowadays are highly sophisticated and are the backbone of any business where sales are involved. The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online.
