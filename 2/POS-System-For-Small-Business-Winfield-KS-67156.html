<p>POS or Point of Sale refers to the system that records financial transactions in stores and restaurants. Veeqo is a POS and order management system that streamlines sales channels for multi-outlet e-commerce businesses. Cozy POS is a best restaurant management software which comes with features such as web portal access for remote outlet management, multiple outlet management and office management.

Menu building — Building a menu can be a complex endeavor, but restaurant POS systems allow you to see your inventory and build a menu that's appropriate. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions.</p>
