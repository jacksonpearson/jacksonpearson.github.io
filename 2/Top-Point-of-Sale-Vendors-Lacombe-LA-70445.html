<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>

<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
