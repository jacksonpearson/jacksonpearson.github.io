<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. A good place to start is with your inventory management system provider. Take deposits and partial payments on layaway sales, or let your customers pay on account.
