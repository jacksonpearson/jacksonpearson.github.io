<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business.</p>

Bar inventory management software has up-to-date inventory.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
<p>Most restaurant POS vendors, however, supply hardware as well as software. A retail management software offers managers to keep track of performance, sale volume and more even when they are not on the floor. Traditionally, the restaurant POS system is where a customer makes a payment in exchange for goods or services.

<p>Also, since your revenues will rise, spending time on forecasting and analysis will have a bigger return on investment, so we added features of a POS system that will help you with forecasting as well. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>
<p>There's an option for remote management of the POS, too. Harbortouch online ordering (HOLO) allows your customers to place an order online creating a ticket in your Harbortouch bar and restaurant POS system. The integration with Dynamics 365 Business Central combines POS system, financial management, accounting, management of orders and products, inventory management, reports and statistics in one complete solution.</p>

But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities.

<p>Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.
