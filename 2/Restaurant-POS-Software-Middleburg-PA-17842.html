<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Thus, a retail owner should take a careful matching of POS softwares and hardwares. It's our fastest reader ever - processing payments in seconds - and it's easy to integrate with our POS software. You should choose cloud-based bar POS software that enables order taking, payment processing, employee management, inventory tracking, data recording and real-time reporting. If you're in need of a POS that has great robust inventory management built in to it then I suggest you give the Hike a test and consider it.</p>

<p>As much as possible, go for a POS that can boost profits by providing a fast and efficient check-out process, manage inventory and sales reports, and provide income generating programs like loyalty rewards and discount promos. Cash registers are not as evolved as using a POS system and lack many of the functions and features of a modern day point of sale system like Square Point of Sale A cash register could be considered a point of sale solution technically, however, for our definitions, we will be focusing on point-of-sale machines (aka POS terminals) that involve both software and hardware.</p>
