<p>Reward vouchers printed at point of sale can help keep diners and drinkers loyal. Manage your restaurant with inventory management, employee management, and live sales figures. Your POS equipment can provide your customers with more information on the product, and can even suggest additional products that match the original sale to make the upsale easier. Good point-of-sales software should let you receive payment for services and products. The software integrates well with other systems from Sysco like Cake OrderPad, Cake Guest Manager, and Cake Online Ordering.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
