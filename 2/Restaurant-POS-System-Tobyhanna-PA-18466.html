<p>Technology has been moving at an amazing avalanche pace. This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile.

A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>

<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality.
