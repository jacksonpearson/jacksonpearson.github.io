<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>

A perfect POS solution for retail businesses , it is widely used in handling customer, sales, and inventory management tasks.

Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
