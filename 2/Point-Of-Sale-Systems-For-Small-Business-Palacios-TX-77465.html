<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well.

Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>
